The extension folder contain the CityJSON schemas.

My extension schema `'test_schema.json'` and the example schema `'noise.json'` is under folder extension/extensions.

The validate file '`validate-extension.py'` is also under folder extension/extensions:

```
Small script to validate a CityJSON_Extension file.

To use simply put the CityJSON_Extension file in the `/extensions` folder of the [CityJSON schemas](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/schemas/cityjson/), and then:

​```
python validate-extension.py myextension.json
​```

And then the file will be validated against the schema for extensions `/extensions/extension.schema.json
```

`
